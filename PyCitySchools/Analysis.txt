Across the schools surveyed, the overall averages of the students going to any
given school ranged from the mid-70s to the mid-80s. The scores of students
seems to rise when the school is a charter school, and the spending per capita
seems to be inversely proportional to the average grades of the student body in a 
given school. Grade level does not seem to play an important role in determining
the average grades of the student body in a given subject. Overall, smaller
schools seem to have an advantage in their grades over larger schools, and
charter schools have significantly better passing rates than district schools,
especially in the subject of math.
